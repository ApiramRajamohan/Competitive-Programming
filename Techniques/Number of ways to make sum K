We can choose N numbers from (1 to infinity) that 
      x1 + x2 + ..... + xn = K
      there number of ways to do this  = (N + K - 1)! / ((N-1)! * K!)
      Why? It’s easy to prove. Consider a vector (1, 1, …, 1) consisting of (N+K-1) ones, in which we want to substitute 
      N-1 ones for zeroes in such way that we’ll get n groups of ones (some of which may be empty)
      and the number of ones in the ith group will be the value of xi.
      The sum of xi will be k, because k ones are left after substitution.
